# Phishing Email Analysis Report

## 📨 Email Subject:
**Please verify your email address**

## 🧑‍💻 Sender Address:
**g!daddy@bigdogdomains.co**

> ⚠️ This is a suspicious and spoofed email address. It mimics GoDaddy (a known domain registrar) but is actually from `bigdogdomains.co`, which is not affiliated with GoDaddy.


## 🕵️‍♀️ Phishing Indicators:

### 1. **Spoofed Sender Email**
- Legitimate companies like GoDaddy use verified domains (e.g., `@godaddy.com`).
- Here, the sender is `bigdogdomains.co`, a suspicious domain.

### 2. **Urgency to Act**
- The email states: **"Your domain will go on hold in 24 hours"**.
- This creates **panic** and forces the recipient to act quickly without verifying the email's legitimacy.

### 3. **Deceptive Link Text**
- The button “Click here to verify your email” or “Login Secure-Link” seems secure.
- However, phishing emails often hide **malicious URLs** behind buttons or links.
- The actual URL (not shown in screenshot) would likely lead to a **fake login page**.

### 4. **Impersonation of GoDaddy**
- The GoDaddy **logo** is used at the top.
- But there's **no personalization** – no user name, domain name, or customer ID is mentioned.

### 5. **Unprofessional Formatting**
- The text formatting, button styling, and footer spacing look **unrefined and unofficial**.
- Real GoDaddy emails follow strict branding and layout standards.

### 6. **Generic Greeting**
- No user-specific details, just a general message.
- Professional services typically greet users by their registered name or domain.

### 7. **Unclear Sender Identity**
- The “Login Secure-Link” term and domain structure are misleading.
- This is not a known GoDaddy phrase.
